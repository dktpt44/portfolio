# Portfolio

## Project Description:

This is my portfolio website. The task was to build a portfolio to tell a story. Also it was important to put all the projects in the website together. The goal was to build a personal website which tells my story while also providing links to the previous projects that I've done in the class.

## Process:

At the very first step, I designed wireframes. I had to make it a comprehensive one because it is a big project and I would get stuck trying to figure out what to build. After wireframe, I did some research to pull some images as reference. I had to know what the layout should like to build it. I used css, trial and error to get the perfect match. Then after I build the desktop, I put folders, build a personal website, build custom listview for projects, lab and included a game that I had build a long time ago. After everything was ready, I made it responsive as well. I made sure everything looks good on phone view as well. The recommended phone is Samsung Galaxy S20. This part was not difficult as I only had to change some CSS to get the effect I wanted.

**WireFrame:**

## Reflection/Evaluation:

Overall, I am proud of what I have build in this project. My initial plan was to build the layout for Mac as well, but it was too time consuming. I think, I've met all the basic requirements for the project and also enjoyed working on this. I am actually now planning to build a custom OS feel as my personal portfolio.
